# FastTouschekTracking

This repository includes code and examples for the Fast Touschek Tracking (FTT) method in the MATLAB version of Accelerator Toolbox. 
FTT enables order-of-magnitude faster computation of local momentum acceptance in 4th generation light sources. The code can easily be modified for parallel computing.

Tested on MATLAB 2022a and 2023b.
